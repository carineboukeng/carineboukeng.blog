| environmenr                         | together formed by living beings and all that surrounds them                |
| bioclimatic comfort                 | biologically liveable environment|
|insolation                           | action of sun rays on something|
| bioclimatic confort                 | environment conducive to life|
| wind tunnel                         | machine or assembly of machines intended for aeration or to produce the wind necessary in certain treatments
| numerical modelling                 | it consists of constructing a set of mathematical functions describing the phenomenon|
| physical modelling                  | Analogical modeling consists in constructing a physical system that reproduces more or less a phenomenon that one wishes to study. Observation of the behavior of the model makes it possible to draw lessons on the phenomenon of interest.|

| lanscaping                          | is a technical, artistic and scientific discipline, which consists of the requalification sanitary and aesthetic of a soil, in order to add to it an added value meeting social needs|
urban greening                        | Any attempt at revegetation of the territory, namely the planting of trees, shrubs, climbing plants, flowers, vegetables, turf, etc., which aims to improve the quality of the environment, the economic benefits or the aesthetic value of the urban landscaping|

| Published in?                |  Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH GeIn general, many, part of Springer Nature 2019                    |
| General topic?               |  In general, this project aims to improve the quality of the environment through the compensation of bioclimatic discomfort. this is to highlight the action of the wind on the residential complexes in Moscow   |
| Procedure/what was examined? |  As a research method, physical modeling in a wind tunnel and numerical modeling in specialized software complexes are considered. The studies were conducted on the basis of the educational, scientific and scientific production laboratory for the construction of aerodynamic and aeroacoustic tests (ESPLab AATBC) using the aerodynamic tunnel with a large gradient of research|
| Conclusions/discovery?       |   The results of a comprehensive computer and experimental study of the effect of wind on urban areas are used to develop design solutions (landscaping and urban planning), with a view to integrated soil improvement to compensate for the discomfort bioclimatic     |
