| General topic?|   This article shows the influence of man on the disruption of the carbon cycle by bush fires and most combustion of fossil fuels                                                                |

| Procedure/what was examined?|   the method used for this study is the graphical observation that shows the variation of the carbon                            |

| Conclusions/discovery?|   the accumulation of atmospheric CO2 induces global warming by increasing the greenhouse effect. It is also accompanied by an acidification of the oceans that affects marine organisms                                                                                              |
