| General topic?               |   |this study consists in highlighting the variability of African species in an environment, the variability between individuals of the same species and the interaction between species in ecosystems                                                                |
| Procedure/what was examined? |  As a research, the method used is based on the observation of fossil species and living species.                              
|
| Conclusions/discovery?       |  in conclusion, ecosystems have varied tremendously over the millions of years of evolution and adaptation, there is variation between different species and between individuals of the same species                          |
| Remaining questions?         |  there are not
