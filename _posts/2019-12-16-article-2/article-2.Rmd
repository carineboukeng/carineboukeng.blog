|  General topic?                                    |  our global was to reconstruct dynamic of a global freshwater invader, the red swamp crayfish, precambrius clarkii, through the analysis of its genetic variability in both native and inversive range                                               |
| Procedure/what was examined?                       | Samplin, DNA extraction and sequencing, Genetic analyses                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Conclusions/discovery?                             |   our finding highlight the value of genetic analyses to identify the geographic origine of source population as well as the variability of invaded areas in order to reconstruct invasion dynamic and facilitate managment of invasive species      |
|  Remaining questions                               | there are not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
