|climate change impacts       |       Climate-change impacts are the consequences of climate change – both expected and realised – for natural and human systems. Climate impacts research is typically interdisciplinary and frequently involves the construction of climate impact models                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|marine food webs             |   Marine food webs describe the linkages between all living organisms found in the marine environment                                |
|climate change               |        corresponds to a lasting modification of the parameters of the global climate of the Earth or its various regional climates                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|biodiversity                 |      Biodiversity encompasses all living species on Earth, their relationship to one another, and the different genes, ecosystems and species                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|General topic               |  this article highlights the influence of climate change on oceanic ecosystems. in fact it shows that with the advent of climate change, there is a considerable decline in biomass in the oceans.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|Conclusions/discovery?      |   the ensemble projections demonstrate that global ocean animal biomass consistently declines with climate change, and that impacts are amplified at higher trophic levels                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
